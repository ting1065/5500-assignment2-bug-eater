The team initially chose to randomly allocate the assignment, with results documented in TeamEvaluation. Early on, the specifics of the homework were not entirely clear to the group. However, subsequent class discussions helped align everyone's understanding, leading to a consensus that the task distribution was justifiable. This mutual agreement was crucial in preventing any feelings of unfair workload distribution. During the code merging phase, the team conducted a meeting to test the new calculator functionalities. Some issues, such as unclear UI representation of user names in the table, were raised. However, the team collaboratively identified and resolved these problems, leading to constructive and positive interactions.

Areas of improvement identified include seeking clarity from teaching assistants or instructors earlier when facing ambiguities in the task. This proactive approach can save valuable time. Furthermore, the team is considering moving away from random task assignments. Instead, they are contemplating allowing members to choose tasks based on their individual preferences. In cases of overlapping interests, a dual allocation method might be implemented to ensure fairness.
